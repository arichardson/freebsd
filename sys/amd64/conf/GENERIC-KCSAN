# GENERIC-KCSAN -- Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer kernel configuration file
#		   for FreeBSD/amd64
#
# This configuration file removes several debugging options, including
# WITNESS and INVARIANTS checking, which are known to have significant
# performance impact on running systems.  When benchmarking new features
# this kernel should be used instead of the standard GENERIC.
# This kernel configuration should never appear outside of the HEAD
# of the FreeBSD tree.
#
# For more information on this file, please read the config(5) manual page,
# and/or the handbook section on Kernel Configuration Files:
#
#    https://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig-config.html
#
# The handbook is also available locally in /usr/share/doc/handbook
# if you've installed the doc distribution, otherwise always see the
# FreeBSD World Wide Web server (https://www.FreeBSD.org/) for the
# latest information.
#
# An exhaustive list of options and more detailed explanations of the
# device lines is also present in the ../../conf/NOTES and NOTES files.
# If you are in doubt as to the purpose or necessity of a line, check first
# in NOTES.
